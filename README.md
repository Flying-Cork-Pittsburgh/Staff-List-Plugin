Staff Listing plugin for WordPress using Custom Post Types

This is my first crack at writing an actual plugin (vs. placing custom code into the theme's functions.php file).
It was adapted from this plugin by Adam Tootle: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/staff-directory/ It used custom
database tables to store it's data and I thought it was over-complicating things a bit. I wanted to use the power of
custom post types to create the staff listing.

It gives the user the ability to add a custom template for displaying the staff member information using tags such as
[name], [email_link] and so on. The user can also add custom css to style the output. I've included a drag-and-drop
method to sort the staff members and set the default display order.

I am very open to receiving feedback and constructive criticism on this project so I can learn and write better, more
efficent WordPress plugins in the future.
