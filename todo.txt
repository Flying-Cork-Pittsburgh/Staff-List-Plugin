** Think about including some preset templates for styling output
   to make it look nicer and work better out of the box.
   
** Is there a good/appropriate way to not use the [staff_loop] tag
   within the template section? I'm ignoring everything outside of
   that anyway, why use it?
   
** Start working on ability to display a single staff member on a
   page (not using the single.php template for CPTs).
   
   ** This would also require some sort of [single-staff-member-loop].
   
   ** Add [bio_excerpt] tag. As well as an option to set the number 
      of words for the bio excerpt.
   	  
   ** That tag should have a link to the that staff member's single page.
   
   ** Maybe not...I need to think through use cases for this.
